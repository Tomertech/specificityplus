data needs to exist on DFS:

- [X] data (generate with downloaddata.py)
- [X] huggingface wikipedia (generate with downloaddata.py)
- [ ] compute stats via layer_name
    - [ ] use their command line interface for this
- [ ] kv-pairs cache (ask JASON how to handle this)
    - [ ] see what it names the files
    - [ ] handle dynamically automatically
